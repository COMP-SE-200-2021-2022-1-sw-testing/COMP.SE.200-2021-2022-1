- Test cases have been properly documented.The use of test suite has been properly documented.

- Test case name + input clearly define the bugs, but perhaps a brief textual description of the issue would have been a nice addition (in case there are multiple problems within a single test).

- The assessment of bug severity as a whole is OK, but it would be better to give every bug an individual pre-defined severity rating (e.g. 1-5, ”critical”, ”medium”… ) as this would make comparing detected issues easier.

- The test coverage has been well-described in the documentation and gives a clear overview of what has been tested.

- The test target has been well evaluated.
