## Context
The library is meant to be used in a front end application built with React. React promotes functional programming and composition over inheritance.

The application is an E-commerce store selling food products from various small producers. Users can search products by category, price, producer and various other criteria. Products can be added to a shopping cart. Shopping cart automatically updates and shows the total price. Checkout process is handled with a third-party solution.

The food producers can add their products via a previously created portal. The producers can leave some fields blank if they do not want to specify some attributes like category or calories. It has been decided that the store front end is responsible for handling these missing values. Front end is also responsible for making sure that the product descriptions look similar i.e. the first word of a sentence starts with an upper-case letter and that prices are shown with two decimal accuracy.
# Test environment
<!-- Description of the chosen tools, packages, libraries, etc. including possible links to web sources (tutorials, homepages, etc). 
Why these tools were chosen? 
A (UML) diagram of your test setup. The diagram can be an activity or sequence diagram, which ever feels more natural. The diagram can be high-level (abstract), but it should illustrate how your test setup should work and how the chosen tools should interact with each other. -->
# Test cases
<!-- What kind of tests are to be performed (unit, integration, ...) ? 
What parts of the library are to be tested and what aren't? 
Are any functions or components excluded from testing? Why?
How the test results will be documented?
If bugs or issues are found, how are they classified or categorized?
When the tests are considered "passed"? -->
